<h1>Submissions: Call for Participation</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
The Virtual Creatures Competition will be held in the competition session at the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference. The contest's purpose is to
highlight progress in virtual creatures research and
 showcase evolutionary computation's ability to craft interesting 
well-adapted creatures with evolved morphologies and/or controllers.
</p>

<h2>Entry Submission</h2>

<p>Entrants must submit a video (up to 5 minutes in length), along with a brief description (one page maximum) describing the video and the evolutionary approach underlying it (with references to a more complete technical description if it exists). The video should demonstrate an evolved virtual creature (or many such creatures) engaging in interesting well-adapted behavior.</p>

<p>Submissions should be emailed to <a href="mailto:nac93@cornell.edu">nac93@cornell.edu</a> by <b>June 20</b>, 2017. Videos should be submitted as a link to an online movie service like vimeo (or youtube). Entries will be acknowledged on receipt. Note that judges will watch videos with sound enabled if you choose to include audio with your video.  
</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>For the purposes of this contest, “virtual creatures” are roughly defined as having evolved morphology and/or control, and being evaluated in physical simulation (2D or 3D). This definition is purposefully indefinite, and acknowledges that it is hard to explicitly delineate between virtual creatures and evolutionary robotics as a whole. Please feel free to email the organizers if you have a potential submission of which you are unsure if it will qualify. </p>
<p>
Judges will be advised of this rough definition, and if more than half of the judges flag an entry as not relevant to the competition, it will be disqualified. Based on previous competitions, the organizers do not think this mechanism is likely to be executed in practice.</p>

<h2>Evaluation</h2> 

<p>Video entries will be judged equally over the following criteria, with a winner selected for best overall score, and honorable mention for all entries in the Pareto front.</p>

<ul>
 <li>Perceptual Animacy (perceived aliveness)</li>
 <li>Technical Achievement</li>
 <li>Aesthetic Appeal</li>
 <li>Innovation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Presentation</h2>

<p>
Finalists selected by the jury will be invited to present their
submission at the competition session, held during the GECCO
conference. The winner of the competition will be announced at the
SIGEVO meeting ceremony.
</p>

<p>
Videos of finalists not attending the conference will be presented by the organizers, and for all participants, anonymized feedback from the judges will be forwarded. After the contest is over, results will be posted to the website, and winners not attending the conference will be notified.
</p>

<h2>Important Dates</h2>

<ul>
<li>Submission deadline: June 20, 2017</li>
<li>Notification of Finalists: July 14, 2017</li>
<li>Conference: July 15-19, 2017</li>
